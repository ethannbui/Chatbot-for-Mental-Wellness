# Chatbot-for-Mental-Wellness (Mind-Care AI)

**Mind-Care AI** is an AI-assisted mental health support prototype built at the **Cal Poly Pomona Hackathon 2025** by **our team: Ai Mavericks**. It explores how retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) + text classification can help people get faster, more accessible support and insights.

**Why we built this**
Depression and mental illness affect millions of people, and many still don’t seek therapy. Delayed or inaccessible treatment can worsen outcomes.

**What Mind-Care AI does**
Mind-Care AI aims to:
- Provide **supportive responses** grounded in curated resources
- Help with **written-text risk detection** (suicide vs. non-suicide) using a labeled dataset
- Lay groundwork for **crisis intervention**, **insights**, and future partnerships

**How it works (Prototype / Workflow)**
We collected professional sources via Google Scholar, stored them in **Google Drive + Pinecone**, embedded them using **OpenAI**, and used **n8n** to orchestrate a ChatGPT-like RAG flow.

**Future directions**
- Crisis intervention & support
- Data-driven mental health insights
- Insurance & healthcare partnerships
- Scalability with emerging tech
